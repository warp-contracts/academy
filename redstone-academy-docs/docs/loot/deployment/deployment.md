## 🔒 Deploy your contract

The smart contract deployment code is very similar to the one that we've used in the testing script. You can see an example of the deployment script in [src/tools/deploy-contracts.js.](../src/tools/deploy-contracts.js).

After running the deployment script the contract transaction Id will be printed.
This transaction should be mined on Arweave in about 20-30 minutes. You can check its status on [Viewblock.](https://viewblock.io)

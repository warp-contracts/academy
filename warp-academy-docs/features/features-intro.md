# Features

### 🧑‍🎓 What we will learn

The aim of this section is to give both a basic and advanced understanding of the features specific for the **Warp SDK**. We will cover them one by one to provide building blocks from which it will be possible to develop even the most advanced smart contracts on **Arweave**.

If you want to expand your knowledge or explore interfaces for the features we will explain in the academy, check out [Warp SDK repository](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp).

The Warp team is always willing to help, so if you have any ideas for new chapters or you find incorrect information, please contact us on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/McehtcpmST) or edit page using the dedicated **Edit this page** feature at the bottom of each section.
